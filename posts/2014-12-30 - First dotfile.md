Every morning at Hack Reactor, the computers are wiped and restored to default settings. This makes a great deal of sense for the school. They generally provide a clean, happy dev environment. Sadly, the environment does not include classic `git` shortcuts or the iconic `git-flow` script.

After two weeks of typing out git commands, I had enough. It was time to craft my first dotfile and learn a bit of bash scripting.

Without much further ado: [here it is](https://github.com/AndrewSouthpaw/git-env-setup-for-Hack-Reactor).

It does not contain all the bells and whistles of my dev environment. Perhaps I'll save that for a later time. Just wanted to address a current issue.
