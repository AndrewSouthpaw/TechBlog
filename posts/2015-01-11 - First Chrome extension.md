I created my first [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mbdialmebcekhnihbplpaknfdhiiaeok/publish-accepted)! It makes it much easier to search Stack Overflow. All you do is type `so` into the omnibar, hit space, and then enter your search.

The barrier to entry for making a Chrome extension was far, far lower than I expected. For anyone interested, here are some great resources to get started:

I used the third link as a starting point to make my own custom search.
